Hi, I'm Reza.  
I'm a C++ software engineer.  
I'm eager to share my experience with others. So I'll try record new tutorial
videos and write blog post about computer programming, Modern C++,
Test-Driven-Development and so on.
You can find my videos in my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD63rKtTY3WoxaCE88Rg9AA?view_as=subscriber) channel.
